I know I could've just used the standard library ReadFile() but for
learning sake I figured it be a better experience to try down the path
of reading a file stream rather than a file as a whole

Resources I've used:

- go.dev/doc/
- [gobyexample.com](https://gobyexample.com)
- general google searches of what functions do (mainly did after
  examining code given to me by gobyexample or go.dev/doc
- gemini for help with why packages weren't working (I just had to
  refresh nvim I followed the tutorial correctly)
- gemini for help with why my for loop variable was undefined (I
  misspelled it haha)
- gemini for help with weird case of no new left assigned variables?
- [gemini chat](https://gemini.google.com/share/113cd9851676)
